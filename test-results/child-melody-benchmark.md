# Child melody benchmark status

Benchmarking relies on the TypeScript helper in `scripts/benchmarkChildMelody.ts`. The automated container currently lacks a
Node.js/npm toolchain, so the script and build checks could not be executed here. Run the benchmark locally after installing
Node.js to capture timing numbers.
