# Scenario notes: Pop loops

Short pop-style loops with drums, bass, and synth pads to stress-test separation and rhythm quantization.

## Fixtures to include
- Four-to-the-floor drum loops with simple basslines.
- Synth pad and pluck layers to examine chord/voicing extraction.
- Variants with mild mixing effects (reverb/delay) for realism.

## Checklist
- [ ] Add audio files under `audio/`
- [ ] Add matching MIDI or MusicXML references under `references/`
- [ ] Run mock pipeline benchmark and log results in `results.md`
- [ ] Run full pipeline benchmark (when deps available) and log results in `results.md`
