# Level 05 – Noise Robustness

This suite is generated automatically from the clean Levels 01–03 audio. For each source clip we create noisy variants at 20 dB, 10 dB, and 0 dB SNR using controlled additive white noise. Audio is written as WAV files under `SNR20/`, `SNR10/`, and `SNR0/` the first time the benchmarks run.
